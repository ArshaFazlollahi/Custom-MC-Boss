# Custom-MC-Boss
⭐A mod I made for an MC server with friends that spawns my own custom boss.

This custom boss can be spawned in as a mob in your Minecraft world/server. It has abilities like running incredibly fast, melee-ing the players and shooting eyes-of-ender at the players.

The boss/NPC will also talk in the chat depending on how you interact with it!

You can also change the skin the boss uses to match your own MC skin or any other skin that you'd like to use. Simply head over to textures/others and change the skin file to the one you'd like to use. Just make sure your skin uses the old skin format(ex. the same one used for mobs).

⬇️If you just want to download and play the mod, head over to the "Mod Download" folder and download the .jar file.
